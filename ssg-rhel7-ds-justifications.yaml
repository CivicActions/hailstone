  - rule_id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_grub2_password
    severity: high
    - justification: |
        GlobalNET server instances are in a FedRAMP certified cloud that maintains control
        over the bootloader. AWS does not provide a way to type in a bootloader password
        during the boot process.
        
  - rule_id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_install_mcafee_antivirus
    severity: high
    - justification: |
        GlobalNET employs ClamAV rather than McAfee for anti-virus scanning.
        
  - rule_id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_grub2_enable_fips_mode
    severity: high
    - justification: |
        Full FIPS mode is not available in the AWS us-east cloud as the hardware is not
        guaranteed to be certified. However, GlobalNET makes use of FIPS compliant openssl
        software and SSL certificates.
